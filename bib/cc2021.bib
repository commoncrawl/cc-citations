                 sources like patents and US military websites. Then we explore the content of the text itself, and find
                 machine-generated text (e.g., from machine translation systems) and evaluation examples from other

                 (NLP), recent years have seen a proliferation of large, web-mined text datasets covering hundreds of
                 languages. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of these publicly
                 available datasets, or whether the datasets actually contain content in the languages they claim to
                 represent. In this work, we manually audit the quality of 205 language-specific corpora released with
                 five major public datasets (CCAligned, ParaCrawl, WikiMatrix, OSCAR, mC4), and audit the correctness of
                 language codes in a sixth (JW300). We find that lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: at least
                 15 corpora are completely erroneous, and a significant fraction contains less than 50\% sentences of
                 acceptable quality. Similarly, we find 82 corpora that are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous
                 language codes. We demonstrate that these issues are easy to detect even for non-speakers of the
                 languages in question, and supplement the human judgements with automatic analyses. Inspired by our

                 iii) full parsing of CCC. [...] we build upon our previous approach [40] where we developed a dataset

                 speech, racial biases, and gender biases – we believe that it is up for debate whether this discourse

                 we present the Pile: an 825 GiB English text corpus targeted at training large-scale language models.
                 The Pile is constructed from 22 diverse high-quality subsets—both existing and newly
                 constructed—many of which derive from academic or professional sources. Our evaluation of the untuned

                 such as academic writing. Conversely, models trained on the Pile improve significantly over both Raw CC
                 and CC-100 on all components of the Pile, while improving performance on downstream evaluations.
                 Through an in-depth exploratory analysis, we document potentially concerning aspects of the data for

                 turn to the Common Crawl for most or all of their data (Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2019). While
                 training on the Common Crawl has been effective, recent work has shown that dataset diversity leads to
                 better downstream generalization capability (Rosset, 2019). [...] we also introduce a new filtered
                 subset of Common Crawl, Pile-CC, with improved extraction quality. [...] 2.1 Pile-CC Common Crawl is a
                 collection of website crawls from 2008 onwards, including raw web pages, metadata and text extractions.
                 Due to the raw nature of the dataset, Common Crawl has the advantage of including text from diverse
                 domains, but at the cost of varying quality data. Due to this, use of Common Crawl typically
                 necessitates well-designed extraction and filtering. Our Common Crawl-based dataset, Pile-CC, uses
                 jusText (Endrédy and Novák, 2013) on Web Archive files (raw HTTP responses including page HTML) for

                 losing by a significant margin on LAMBADA and WikiText. We hypothesize that this is due to the
                 perplexity based filtering used in CC-100, where a language model is trained on Wikipedia and all data
                 with a perplexity too high or too low is discarded. This effectively discards any data too similar to
                 or too different from Wikipedia, which severely limits the diversity of the collected data. This result
                 suggests that future work using Common Crawl should take caution with filtering to preserve its

                 computing the leaves (most refined), and then propagating this information upwards to the root of the
                 tree. We first describe new sequential algorithms, both in RAM and external memory. Based on these
                 results, we adapt these algorithms to parallel computers, where we address both shared memory and
                 distributed memory settings.In practice, all our algorithms outperform previous ones in both time and
                 memory efficiency, because we can compute all auxiliary information solely based on the information we
                 obtained from computing the leaves. Most of our algorithms are also adapted to the wavelet matrix, a

                 Their scores are relative to the specific sample, which makes multicultural or international
                 assessments difficult. Our results show that a shorter and simpler task with automatic and objective
                 scoring may be at least as reliable at measuring verbal creativity. This finding enables assessments
                 across larger and more diverse samples with less bias.Several theories posit that creative people are
                 able to generate more divergent ideas. If this is correct, simply naming unrelated words and then
                 measuring the semantic distance between them could serve as an objective measure of divergent thinking.
                 To test this hypothesis, we asked 8,914 participants to name 10 words that are as different from each
                 other as possible. A computational algorithm then estimated the average semantic distance between the
                 words; related words (e.g., cat and dog) have shorter distances than unrelated ones (e.g., cat and
                 thimble). We predicted that people producing greater semantic distances would also score higher on
                 traditional creativity measures. In Study 1, we found moderate to strong correlations between semantic
                 distance and two widely used creativity measures (the Alternative Uses Task and the
                 Bridge-the-Associative-Gap Task). In Study 2, with participants from 98 countries, semantic distances
                 varied only slightly by basic demographic variables. There was also a positive correlation between
                 semantic distance and performance on a range of problems known to predict creativity. Overall, semantic
                 distance correlated at least as strongly with established creativity measures as those measures did
                 with each other. Naming unrelated words in what we call the Divergent Association Task can thus serve
                 as a brief, reliable, and objective measure of divergent thinking.The data and algorithm code have been

                 on threat theory—which links minorities’ political power to hostility against minoritized

                 are met: 1) the publication date is on election day and up to 10 months after each general election⁹,
                 2) the article contains mentions of terms referring to the candidate’s country or nationality of
                 origin, which are extracted with the named entity annotator of CoreNLP and 3) such mentions co-occur in
                 the article with a mention referring to the candidate’s constituency. The constituency is extracted

                 Place Names in Great Britain, and mapping to the corresponding constituency. Overall, this data

                 elements Newspaper data We construct the dataset of newspaper articles using the following steps. To
                 determine a comprehensive list of UK newspapers, we first identified a list of seed categories on
                 Wikipedia (WP) (e.g. ’Category:Newspapers_published_in_England’), we took the recursive items of
                 those categories (e.g. ’Category:Newspapers_published_in_England’ >
                 ’Category:Newspapers_published_in_London’), we used WP article properties to filter out articles
                 about non-newspapers (e.g. people, books), and we extracted the newspaper URLs from the WP Infobox
                 using the Python package wptools. With this process we identified a list of UK newspapers URLs
                 containing 337 newspapers in total. Then, to obtain the articles published by each of these newspapers,
                 we looked up the URLs in Common Crawl (an open repository of web crawl data containing a snapshot of
                 every web page at the moment of the crawl). Particularly in the Index for 2020-16 crawl, the most

                 (Radford et al., 2018, 2019; Gokaslan and Cohen, 2019; Rosset, 2019; Shoeybi et al., 2019; Devlin et
                 al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2021). This data is
                 increasingly derived from internet corpora like Common Crawl (Radford et al., 2019; Ortiz Suárez et
                 al., 2019; Wenzek et al., 2020; Conneau et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Raffel et
                 al., 2020). However, the quality of raw Common Crawl data is often insufficient to be directly used. To
                 combat this, many existing works use some kind of proxy for quality, like a classifier between known
                 high quality data and low quality data (Brown et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2021),
                 handcrafted heuristics (Yang et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020), or keeping only documents with
                 perplexity scores that fall in some middle quantile of an existing language model (Wenzek et al.,
                 2020). Brown et al. (2020) in particular filter extremely aggres- sively using their classifier,
                 discarding about 98.7% of their data. Previous work has shown that models trained on heuristic-filtered
                 datasets perform better on downstream tasks (Raffel et al., 2020). However, Gao et al. (2020) show that
                 a perplexity-filtered CC- derived dataset actually performs worse than unfiltered CC on certain tasks.
                 [...] We hypothesize that this decline in performance is because of misalignment between the classifier
                 objective, intended to be a proxy for quality, and actual document quality. For instance, a classifier
                 to distinguish WebText2 from Common Crawl, as in GPT-3, would also exclude domains of text data not
                 found as often in WebText2.",

                 archive (dated April 2021) is roughly 320 TB in size and spans 3.1 billion pages. The sheer scale of
                 this dataset has an enduring allure in the AI community and has been used as a seeding dataset in

                 suffers from serious issues. For instance, Matic et al. [37] used the Curlie.org crowdsourced taxonomy
                 project to train a GDPR-Article(9)-Sensitive-URL classifier which revealed that, of the 1 Billion URLs
                 they audited in the Common Crawl project, 155 million URLs fell into the sensitive category. The
                 Realtoxicityprompts work [38] revealed that CommonCrawl contained over 300,000 documents from
                 unreliable news sites and banned subReddit pages containing hate speech and racism. More recently,
                 Luccioni and Viviano’s initial study [39] placed the ‘Hate speech’ content level to be around
                 4.02%-5.24% (the 1+ hate n-grams level was estimated higher at 17.78%). With regards to CCAligned, a
                 119- language parallel dataset built off 68 snapshots of Common Crawl, Caswell et al. [40] revealed
                 that there were notable amounts of pornographic content (> 10%) found for 11 languages with prevalence

                 Africa (8/18) have more pages in MS-All than in Common Crawl. Six out of 63 Eurasian languages have
                 more articles in MS-All than in Common Crawl. When we consider even just the heavily filtered automatic

                 has resulted in limited dataset curation methodology development (Section 5.1) and limited automatic
                 summarisation system design (Section 5.2).",
