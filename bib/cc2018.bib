  abstract     = "``How common is interactive visualization on the web?'' ``What is the most popular visualization
                 design?'' ``How prevalent are pie charts really?'' These questions intimate the role of interactive
                 visualization in the real (online) world. In this paper, we present our approach (and findings) to
                 answering these questions. First, we introduce Beagle, which mines the web for SVG-based visualizations
                 and automatically classifies them by type (i.e., bar, pie, etc.). With Beagle, we extract over 41,000
                 visualizations across five different tools and repositories, and classify them with 85\% accuracy,
                 across 24 visualization types. Given this visualization collection, we study usage across tools. We
                 find that most visualizations fall under four types: bar charts, line charts, scatter charts, and
                 geographic maps. Though controversial, pie charts are relatively rare for the visualization tools that
                 were studied. Our findings also suggest that the total visualization types supported by a given tool
                 could factor into its ease of use. However this effect appears to be mitigated by providing a variety
                 of diverse expert visualization examples to users.",

                 language processing, leading to state-of-the-art performance. A key ingredient to the successful
                 application of these representations is to train t hem on very large corpora, and use these pre-trained
                 models in downstream tasks. In this paper, we describe how we trained such high qualit y word
                 representations for 157 languages. We used two sources of data to train these models: the free online
                 encyclopedia Wikip edia and data from the common crawl project. We also introduce three new word
                 analogy datasets to evaluate these word vectors, for Fren ch, Hindi and Polish. Finally, we evaluate
                 our pre-trained word vectors on 10 languages for which evaluation datasets exists, sho wing very strong
                 performance compared to previous models.",

                 knowledge, it was not used yet to learn word vectors for a large set of languages. The data is
                 distributed either as raw HTML pages, or as WET files which contain the extracted text data, converted
                 to UTF-8. We decided to use the extracted text data, as it is much smaller in size, and easier to

                 successfully applied to portable executable (PE) malware detection, we ask, can we extend similar ap-
                 proaches to detect malware across heterogeneous file types commonly found in email attachments? In this
                 paper, we explore the feasibility of applying machine learning as a static countermeasure to detect
                 several types of malicious email attachments including Microsoft Office documents and Zip archives. To
                 this end, we collected a dataset of over 5 million malicious/benign Microsoft Office documents from
                 VirusTotal for evaluation as well as a dataset of benign Microsoft Office documents from the Common
                 Crawl corpus, which we use to provide more realistic estimates of thresholds for false positive rates
                 on in-the- wild data. We also collected a dataset of approximately 500k malicious/benign Zip archives,
                 which we scraped using the VirusTotal service, on which we performed a separate evaluation. We analyze
                 predictive performance of several classifiers on each of the VirusTotal datasets using a 70/30
                 train/test split on first seen time, evaluating feature and classifier types that have been applied
                 successfully in commercial antimalware products and R&D contexts. Using deep neural networks and
                 gradient boosted decision trees, we are able to obtain ROC curves with >0.99 AUC on both Microsoft

We start with  the crawl data, extract the pages of interest int o a private storage bucket,  and  then process it to  remove unwanted words/tags. At the end , visualization tools are used to graphically display the  results. These can be used to publish standard reports or customized by users to support their  own analysis."
