                 according to which words that are used and occur in the same contexts tend to possess similar meanings.
                 As a consequence, emotionally dissimilar words, such as “happy” and “sad” occurring in similar
                 contexts would purport more similar meaning than emotionally similar words, such as “happy” and
                 “joy”. This complication leads to rather undesirable outcome in predictive tasks that relate to
                 affect (emotional state), such as emotion classification and emotion similarity. In order to address
                 this limitation, we propose a novel method of obtaining emotion-enriched word representations, which
                 projects emotionally similar words into neighboring spaces and emotionally dissimilar ones far apart.
                 The proposed approach leverages distant supervision to automatically obtain a large training dataset of
                 text documents and two recurrent neural network architectures for learning the emotion-enriched
                 representations. Through extensive evaluation on two tasks, including emotion classification and
                 emotion similarity, we demonstrate that the proposed representations outperform several competitive
                 general-purpose and affective word representations.",

                 answering these questions. First, we introduce Beagle, which mines the web for SVG-based visualizations
                 and automatically classifies them by type (i.e., bar, pie, etc.). With Beagle, we extract over 41,000
                 visualizations across five different tools and repositories, and classify them with 85\% accuracy,
                 across 24 visualization types. Given this visualization collection, we study usage across tools. We
                 find that most visualizations fall under four types: bar charts, line charts, scatter charts, and
                 geographic maps. Though controversial, pie charts are relatively rare for the visualization tools that
                 were studied. Our findings also suggest that the total visualization types supported by a given tool
                 could factor into its ease of use. However this effect appears to be mitigated by providing a variety

  abstract     = "This paper concentrates on extracting painting art history knowledge from the network structure of
                 Wikipedia. Therefore, we construct theoretical networks of webpages representing the hyper-linked
                 structure of articles of seven Wikipedia language editions. These seven networks are analyzed to
                 extract the most influential painters in each edition using Google matrix theory. Importance of
                 webpages of over 3000 painters is measured using the PageRank algorithm. The most influential painters
                 are enlisted and their ties are studied with the reduced Google matrix analysis. The reduced Google
                 matrix is a powerful method that captures both direct and hidden interactions between a subset of
                 selected nodes taking into account the indirect links between these nodes via the remaining part of
                 large global network. This method originates from the scattering theory of nuclear and mesoscopic
                 physics and field of quantum chaos. In this paper, we show that it is possible to extract from the
                 components of the reduced Google matrix meaningful information on the ties between these painters. For
                 instance, our analysis groups together painters that belong to the same painting movement and shows
                 meaningful ties between painters of different movements. We also determine the influence of painters on
                 world countries using link sensitivity between Wikipedia articles of painters and countries. The
                 reduced Google matrix approach allows to obtain a balanced view of various cultural opinions of
                 Wikipedia language editions. The world countries with the largest number of top painters of selected

                 language processing, leading to state-of-the-art performance. A key ingredient to the successful
                 application of these representations is to train t hem on very large corpora, and use these pre-trained
                 models in downstream tasks. In this paper, we describe how we trained such high qualit y word
                 representations for 157 languages. We used two sources of data to train these models: the free online
                 encyclopedia Wikip edia and data from the common crawl project. We also introduce three new word
                 analogy datasets to evaluate these word vectors, for Fren ch, Hindi and Polish. Finally, we evaluate
                 our pre-trained word vectors on 10 languages for which evaluation datasets exists, sho wing very strong
                 performance compared to previous models.",

                 knowledge, it was not used yet to learn word vectors for a large set of languages. The data is
                 distributed either as raw HTML pages, or as WET files which contain the extracted text data, converted

                 1326 elementary level science facts. Roughly 6000 questions probe an understanding of these facts and
                 their application to novel situations. This requires combining an open book fact (e.g., metals conduct
                 electricity) with broad common knowledge (e.g., a suit of armor is made of metal) obtained from other
                 sources. While existing QA datasets over documents or knowledge bases, being generally self-contained,
                 focus on linguistic understanding, OpenBookQA probes a deeper understanding of both the topic{---}in
                 the context of common knowledge{---}and the language it is expressed in. Human performance on
                 OpenBookQA is close to 92{\%}, but many state-of-the-art pre-trained QA methods perform surprisingly
                 poorly, worse than several simple neural baselines we develop. Our oracle experiments designed to
                 circumvent the knowledge retrieval bottleneck demonstrate the value of both the open book and
                 additional facts. We leave it as a challenge to solve the retrieval problem in this multi-hop setting

                 in which fixed-length blocks of postings data are compressed independently of each other. Building on
                 previous work in which asymmetric numeral systems (ANS) entropy coding is used to represent each block,
                 we explore a number of enhancements: (i) the use of two-dimensional conditioning contexts, with two
                 aggregate parameters used in each block to categorize the distribution of symbol values that underlies
                 the ANS approach, rather than just one; (ii) the use of a byte-friendly strategic mapping from symbols
                 to ANS codeword buckets; and (iii) the use of a context merging process to combine similar probability
                 distributions. Collectively, these improvements yield superior compression for index data,
                 outperforming the reference point set by the Interp mechanism, and hence representing a significant
                 step forward. We describe experiments using the 426 GiB gov2 collection and a new large collection of

                 the hypernym discovery problem). Witt takes as input a phrase describing a software technology or
                 concept and returns a general category that describes it (e.g., integrated development environment),
                 along with attributes that further qualify it (commercial, php, etc.). By extension, the approach
                 enables the dynamic creation of lists of all technologies of a given type (e.g., web application
                 frameworks). Our approach relies on Stack Overflow and Wikipedia, and involves numerous original domain
                 adaptations and a new solution to the problem of normalizing automatically-detected hypernyms. We
                 compared Witt with six independent taxonomy tools and found that, when applied to software terms, Witt
                 demonstrated better coverage than all evaluated alternate solutions, without a corresponding
                 degradation in false positive rate.",

  abstract     = "Efficient storage of large inverted indexes is one of the key technologies that support current web
                 search services. Here we re-examine mechanisms for representing document-level inverted indexes and
                 within-document term frequencies, including comparing specialized methods developed for this task
                 against recent fast implementations of general-purpose adaptive compression techniques. Experiments
                 with the Gov2-URL collection and a large collection of crawled news stories show that standard
                 compression libraries can provide compression effectiveness as good as or better than previous methods,
                 with decoding rates only moderately slower than reference implementations of those tailored approaches.
                 This surprising outcome means that high-performance index compression can be achieved without requiring
                 the use of specialized implementations.",
  cc-snippet   = "We also develop (and make freely available) a new IR test collection based on the News sub-collection
                 of the Common Crawl∗∗. The News sub-collection provides daily crawls of news websites in many
                 languages. We refer to this collection as CC-NEWS-URL. We provide all scripts to download the freely
                 available source WARC files from Amazon AWS and process them using Apache Tika and Apache Lucene in a
                 consistent manner. The resulting consistency enables researchers to perform experiments on exactly the
                 collection in their experiments, and improves comparability of results between different rounds of
                 experimentation. For example, the number of terms reported for the GOV2-URL collection ranges from 18
                 million up to 48 million, preventing fair and direct comparison between results reported in different
                 papers. The number of WARC files in CC-NEWS-URL increases each day, and hence we specify the collection
                 using: (1) a date range; and (2) a language filter. For example, in this work, we utilize the
                 CC-NEWS-20160901-2017028-EN collection which uses all English language news sources (as identified by
                 Apache Tika) from 01/09/2016 up until and including 28/02/2017, that is, a six month crawl period that
                 contains 7,508,082 documents, 26,240,031 unique terms and 4,457,492,131 postings. Currently the
                 CC-NEWS-URL collection grows by roughly 50,000 English documents per day. This exact parsing can be
                 reproduced by the scripts provided at https://github.com/mpetri/rlz-invidx and
                 https://github.com/mpetri/TikaLuceneWarc, with raw postings lists stored in the popular “ds2i”
                 format††. Document identifiers are again reassigned in URL order. We also explored a date-ordered
                 collection based on the same source data, and obtained – method-for-method – uniformly weaker
                 compression outcomes than for URL-sorted, in part because many of the URLs contain dates encoded in
                 them anyway.",

  abstract     = "alicious email attachments are a growing delivery vector for malware. While machine learning has been
                 successfully applied to portable executable (PE) malware detection, we ask, can we extend similar ap-
                 proaches to detect malware across heterogeneous file types commonly found in email attachments? In this
                 paper, we explore the feasibility of applying machine learning as a static countermeasure to detect
                 several types of malicious email attachments including Microsoft Office documents and Zip archives. To
                 this end, we collected a dataset of over 5 million malicious/benign Microsoft Office documents from
                 VirusTotal for evaluation as well as a dataset of benign Microsoft Office documents from the Common
                 Crawl corpus, which we use to provide more realistic estimates of thresholds for false positive rates
                 on in-the-wild data. We also collected a dataset of approximately 500k malicious/benign Zip archives,
                 which we scraped using the VirusTotal service, on which we performed a separate evaluation. We analyze
                 predictive performance of several classifiers on each of the VirusTotal datasets using a 70/30
                 train/test split on first seen time, evaluating feature and classifier types that have been applied
                 successfully in commercial antimalware products and R&D contexts. Using deep neural networks and
                 gradient boosted decision trees, we are able to obtain ROC curves with >0.99 AUC on both Microsoft
                 Office document and Zip archive datasets. Discussion of deployment viability in various antimalware
                 contexts is provided.",

                 domains acquired from the CommonCrawl¹¹. An initial list of Websites was identified for acquisition.
                 The list was built by submitting the CLEF 2018 base queries to the Microsoft Bing APIs (through the
                 Azure Cognitive Services) repeatedly over a period of few weeks¹², and acquiring the URLs of the
                 retrieved results. The domains of the URLs were then included in the list, except some domains that
                 were excluded for decency reasons (e.g. pornhub.com). The list was further augmented by including a
                 number of known reliable health Websites and other known unreliable health Websites, from lists
                 previously compiled by health institutions and agencies. The corpus was divided into folders, by domain
                 name. Each folder contained a file for each Webpage from the domain available in the CommonCrawl dump.
                 In total, 2,021 domains were requested from the CommonCrawl dump of 2018-09¹³. Of the 2,021 domains
                 in total, 1,903 were successfully acquired. The remaining domains were discarded due to errors,
                 corrupted or incomplete data returned by the CommonCrawl API (a total of ten retries were attempted for
                 each domain before giving up on a domain). Of the 1,903 crawled domains, 84 were not available in the
                 CommonCrawl dump, and for these, a folder in the corpus exists and represents the domain that was
                 requested; however, the folder is empty, meaning that it was not available in the dump. Note that .pdf
                 documents were excluded from the data acquired from CommonCrawl. A complete list of domains and size of
                 the crawl data for each domain is available at https://github.com/CLEFeHealth/CLEFeHealth2018IRtask/
                 blob/master/clef2018collection_listofdomains.txt. The full collection, clefehealth2018¹⁴, it
                 contains 5,535,120 Web pages and its uncompressed size is about 480GB. In addition to the full
                 collection, an alternative corpus named clefehealth2018_B¹⁵ was created by manually removing a
                 number of domains that were not strictly health-related (e.g., news Websites). This subset contains
                 1,653 domains and its size is about 294GB, uncompressed.",

                 use neural networks to tackle the Winograd Schema dataset [ 1]. In this paper, we present a simple
                 method for commonsense reasoning with neural networks, using unsupervised learning. Key to our method
                 is the use of language models, trained on a massive amount of unlabled data, to score multiple choice
                 questions posed by commonsense reasoning tests. On both Pronoun Disambiguation and Winograd Schema
                 challenges, our models outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, without using
                 expensive annotated knowledge bases or hand-engineered features. We train an array of large RNN
                 language models that operate at word or character level on LM-1-Billion, CommonCrawl, SQuAD, Gutenberg
                 Books, and a customized corpus for this task and show that diversity of training data plays an
                 important role in test performance. Further analysis also shows that our system successfully discovers
                 important features of the context that decide the correct answer, indicating a good grasp of
                 commonsense knowledge.",
