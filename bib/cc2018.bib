                 application of these representations is to train t hem on very large corpora, and use these pre-trained
                 models in downstream tasks. In this paper, we describe how we trained such high qualit y word
                 representations for 157 languages. We used two sources of data to train these models: the free online
                 encyclopedia Wikip edia and data from the common crawl project. We also introduce three new word
                 analogy datasets to evaluate these word vectors, for Fren ch, Hindi and Polish. Finally, we evaluate
                 our pre-trained word vectors on 10 languages for which evaluation datasets exists, sho wing very strong

                 against recent fast implementations of general-purpose adaptive compression techniques. Experiments
                 with the Gov2-URL collection and a large collection of crawled news stories show that standard
                 compression libraries can provide compression effectiveness as good as or better than previous methods,
                 with decoding rates only moderately slower than reference implementations of those tailored approaches.
                 This surprising outcome means that high-performance index compression can be achieved without requiring
                 the use of specialized implementations.",
