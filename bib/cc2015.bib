                 Common Crawl is overseen by a nonprofit corporation, the Common Crawl Foundation, established in 2007
                 by Gil Elbaz, a software entrepreneur. [...] Work on the crawl is done by a small staff in San
                 Francisco, and by volunteers. [...] Stephen Merity, data scientist for the Common Crawl, explains that
                 the group’s crawling strategy has evolved away from pure reliance on discovering and following links.
                 The crawl’s to-do list now begins with a large set of URLs donated by the search engine Blekko.
                 During the crawl the list of discovered links is pruned to reduce the volume of spam and escape spider
                 traps. The aim is to give precedence to pages of interest to human readers.",
