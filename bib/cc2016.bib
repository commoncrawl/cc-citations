                 In this article we present the construction of 12 million-pages Web corpus (over 10 billion tokens)
                 licensed under CreativeCommons license family in 50+ languages that has been extracted from
                 CommonCrawl, the largest publicly available general Web crawl to date with about 2 billion crawled
                 URLs. Our highly-scalable Hadoop-based framework is able to process the full CommonCrawl corpus on
                 2000+ CPU cluster on the Amazon Elastic Map/Reduce infrastructure. The processing pipeline includes
                 license identification, state-of-the-art boilerplate removal, exact duplicate and near-duplicate
                 document removal, and language detection. The construction of the corpus is highly configurable and
                 fully reproducible, and we provide both the framework (DKPro C4CorpusTools) and the resulting data
                 (C4Corpus) to the research community.",

                 German) copyright legislation categorically forbids the redistribution of downloaded material without
                 express prior permission by the authors. Therefore, stand-off annotations or other derivates are the
                 only format in which European researchers (like myself) are allowed to re-distribute the respective
                 corpora. In order to make the full corpora available to the public despite such restrictions, the
                 stand-off format presented here allows anybody to locally reconstruct the full corpora with the least
                 possible computational effort.",
