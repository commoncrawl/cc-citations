  abstract     = "Removal of boilerplate is one of the essential tasks in web corpus construction and web indexing.
                 Boilerplate (redundant and automatically inserted material like menus, copyright notices, navigational
                 elements, etc.) is usually considered to be linguistically unattractive for inclusion in a web corpus.
                 Also, search engines should not index such material because it can lead to spurious results for search
                 terms if these terms appear in boilerplate regions of the web page. The size of large web corpora
                 necessitates the use of efficient algorithms while a high accuracy directly improves the quality of the
                 final corpus. In this paper, I present and evaluate a supervised machine learning approach to
                 general-purpose boilerplate detection for languages based on Latin alphabets which is both very
                 efficient and very accurate. Using a Multilayer Perceptron and a high number of carefully engineered
                 features, I achieve between 95\% and 99\% correct classifications (depending on the input language)
                 with precision and recall over 0.95. Since the perceptrons are trained on language-specific data, I
                 also evaluate how well perceptrons trained on one language perform on other languages. The single
                 features are also evaluated for the merit they contribute to the classification. I show that the
                 accuracy of the Multilayer Perceptron is on a par with that of other classifiers such as Support Vector
                 Machines. I conclude that the quality of general-purpose boilerplate detectors depends mainly on the
                 availability of many well-engineered features and which are highly language-independent. The method has
                 been implemented in the open-source texrex web page cleaning software, and large corpora constructed
                 using it are available from the COW initiative, including the CommonCOW corpora created from
                 CommonCrawl data sets.",

                 interested in plain text for building the distributed word representation models. Due to the size of
                 the dump, which requires massive processing power and time for handling, we only used 30\% of the data

                 extracted from Common Crawl has several advantages over a direct crawl of web data, among which is
                 removing the likelihood of a user’s home IP address becoming blacklisted for accessing a given web
                 site too frequently. However, Common Crawl is a data sample, and so questions arise about the quality

                 similarity of topics estimated from Common Crawl compared to topics estimated from the full data of
                 online forums. Our target is online discussions from a user forum for automotive enthusiasts, but our
                 research strategy can be applied to other domains and samples to evaluate the representativeness of
                 topic models. We show that topic proportions estimated from Common Crawl are not significantly

                 word compositions, and not worse than topic similarity estimated under true random sampling, which we
                 simulate through a series of experiments. Our research will be of interest to analysts who wish to use
