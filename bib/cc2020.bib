                 free, publicly available web archives, including a continuous crawl of international news articles
                 published in multiple languages. Our derived corpus, CC-News-En, contains 44 million English documents
                 collected between September 2016 and March 2018. The collection is comparable in size with the number
                 of documents typically found in a single shard of a large-scale, distributed search engine, and is four
                 times larger than the news collections previously used in offline information retrieval experiments. To
                 complement the corpus, 173 topics were curated using titles from Reddit threads, forming a temporally
                 representative sampling of relevant news topics over the 583 day collection window. Information needs
                 were then generated using automatic summarization tools to produce textual and audio representations,
                 and used to elicit query variations from crowdworkers, with a total of 10,437 queries collected against
                 the 173 topics. Of these, 10,089 include key-stroke level instrumentation that captures the timings of
                 character insertions and deletions made by the workers while typing their queries. These new resources
                 support a wide variety of experiments, including large-scale efficiency exercises and query

                 crawls of the web at regular intervals. A key philosophy behind the Common Crawlis to democratize data,
                 allowing open access with no fees. In late 2016, the Common Crawl Foundation announced a news-specific
                 crawl (CC-News), [² ] with documents being added on a daily basis, and covering sources from a wide
                 range of countries and languages. Here we derive a static, English segment of the CC-Newscrawl that we
                 refer to as CC-News-En. Due to the storage and computation costs involved in filtering out non-English
                 documents, we make the complete corpus available as a free resource, along with asuite of tools which
                 can be used to replicate corpus extraction from the original source CC-News data. We also provide a set

                 novel crowdworking experiment. Our goal is to encourage reproducible and replicable experimentation,

                 CC-NEWS-20170812163812-00038.warc.gz file was not processed correctly by our pipeline, and was
                 subsequently dropped from the CC-News-En corpus. In addition, there are six days within the 583 day

                 collected data for each variety. Second, the paper evaluates a language identification model that

                 language identification is essential for moving beyond majority languages. Given the focus on language

                 noticed in every aspect of human communication. It’s increasing diffusion, especially since the turn
                 of the century, is hard to measure with conventional means. The present research studies the use of
                 language in websites of European Union (EU) member states, in order to collect data about the
                 prevalence of the English language in the different countries and regions of the European Union.To
                 achieve a realistic representation of today’s landscape of the European Web, this study uses avast
                 population of websites and a representative sampling size and methodology. By analyzing and processing
                 the findings from over 100,000 websites from every country in the EU, a solid foundation is set that is
                 used to explore the dominance of the English language in the European World Wide Web in general. This
                 is the first study that examines the presence of English content in the websites of all EU member
                 countries and provides statistical evidence regarding the ratio of English content availability for
                 each country. Conclusively, the results of the research demonstrate that the English language is
                 available on more than one quarter of all websites of non-English speaking EU member states.Moreover,
                 it is available in the vast majority of multilingual and bilingual websites, while at the same time
                 being the only language that is available in a number of monolingual websites. In addition, it is shown
                 preference over the national language in a significant number of cases. A moderate negative correlation
                 is found between a member state’s population and the availability of English in these countries’
                 websites and the same holds true for a member state’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).Both these
                 correlations indicate that smaller countries tend to provide more content in English in order to
                 establish a stronger presence in the international environment. Taking into account the role of
                 language in the expression of national identity, this study provides data and insights which may
