                 these archives are many orders of magnitude larger than current language modeling datasets, they have
                 significant data quality issues. Trinh & Le (2018) used Common Crawl in their work on commonsense
                 reasoning but noted a large amount of documents “whose content are mostly unintelligible”. We
                 ob-served similar data issues in our initial experiments with Common Crawl. Trinh & Le (2018)’s best
                 results were achieved using a small subsample of Common Crawl which included only documents most
                 similar to their target dataset,the Winograd Schema Challenge. While this is a pragmatic approach to
                 improve performance on a specific task, we want to avoid making assumptions about the tasks to be
                 performed ahead of time.Instead, we created a new web scrape which emphasizes document quality. To do
                 this we only scraped web pages which have been curated/filtered by humans. Manually filtering a full
                 web scrape would be exceptionally expensive so as a starting point, we scraped all outbound links from
                 Reddit, a social media platform, which received at least 3 karma. This can be thought of as a heuristic
                 indicator for whether other users found the link interesting, educational, or just funny. The resulting

                 using the data released by the Common Crawl project.[⁵https://commoncrawl.org/] Each month, a
                 snapshot of the Web containing terabytes of web pages in various languages is obtained by randomly
                 exploring URLs. We start by applying some preprocessing steps to the raw text data, following the
                 pipeline introduced by Wenzek et al. (2019) and leading to the CCNet dataset. The first step is to
                 deduplicate the data at the paragraph level, as the original crawls contain up to 70% of duplicated
                 data. This preprocessing removes low quality content, such as boilerplate, navigation menus or cookie
                 warnings. The second step of the pipeline is to identify the language of each document, using fastText6
                 (Grave et al., 2018). This language identifier uses a linear classifier with character n-gram features,
                 and can recognize up to 176 languages. Finally, the last step of the preprocessing is to filter low
                 quality content by training a language model on Wikipedia, and only keeping documents with a low
                 perplexity score. We refer the reader to Wenzek et al. (2019) for more details about this pre-
                 processing pipeline. In Figure 1, we report the number of unique sentences obtained after preprocessing
                 ten snapshots from Common Crawl. We currently process 38 languages. The English Web content is abundant
