  abstract     = "Pre-training text representations have led to significant improvements in many areas of natural
                 language processing. The quality of these models benefits greatly from the size of the pretraining
                 corpora as long as its quality is preserved. In this paper, we describe an automatic pipeline to
                 extract massive high-quality monolingual datasets from Common Crawl for a variety of languages. Our
                 pipeline follows the data processing introduced in fastText (Mikolov et al., 2017; Grave et al., 2018),
                 that deduplicates documents and identifies their language. We augment this pipeline with a filtering
                 step to select documents that are close to high quality corpora like Wikipedia.",

                 including many low-resource ones. The principles of our pipeline are general and we show the results of
                 its application to data collected by the Common Crawl project.1 Common Crawl is a massive non-curated
                 dataset of webpages in many languages, mixed together in temporal snapshots of the web.",

  cc-snippet   = "A promising source of diverse and nearly unlimited text is web scrapes such as Common Crawl. While
                 these archives are many orders of magnitude larger than current language modeling datasets, they have
                 significant data quality issues. Trinh & Le (2018) used Common Crawl in their work on commonsense
                 reasoning but noted a large amount of documents “whose content are mostly unintelligible”. We
                 ob-served similar data issues in our initial experiments with Common Crawl. Trinh & Le (2018)’s best
                 results were achieved using a small subsample of Common Crawl which included only documents most
                 similar to their target dataset,the Winograd Schema Challenge. While this is a pragmatic approach to
                 improve performance on a specific task, we want to avoid making assumptions about the tasks to be
                 performed ahead of time.Instead, we created a new web scrape which emphasizes document quality. To do
                 this we only scraped web pages which have been curated/filtered by humans. Manually filtering a full
                 web scrape would be exceptionally expensive so as a starting point, we scraped all outbound links from
                 Reddit, a social media platform, which received at least 3 karma. This can be thought of as a heuristic
                 indicator for whether other users found the link interesting, educational, or just funny. The resulting
                 dataset, WebText, contains the text subsetof these 45 million links.",
