  abstract     = "Parallel text is the fuel that drives modern machine translation systems. The Web is a comprehensive
                 source of preexisting parallel text, but crawling the entire web is impossible for all but the largest
                 companies. We bring web-scale parallel text to the masses by mining the Common Crawl, a public Web
                 crawl hosted on Amazon 19s Elastic Cloud. Starting from nothing more than a set of common two-letter
                 language codes, our open-source extension of the STRAND algorithm mined 32 terabytes of the crawl in
                 just under a day, at a cost of about $500. Our large-scale experiment uncovers large amounts of
                 parallel text in dozens of language pairs across a variety of domains and genres, some previously
                 unavailable in curated datasets. Even with minimal cleaning and filtering, the resulting data boosts
                 translation performance across the board for five different language pairs in the news domain, and on
                 open domain test sets we see improvements of up to 5 BLEU. We make our code and data available for
                 other researchers seeking to mine this rich new data resource.",
