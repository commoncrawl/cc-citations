  abstract     = "Phishing is a fraud attempt in which an attacker acts as a trusted person or entity to obtain
                 sensitive information from an internet user. In this Systematic Literature Survey (SLR), different
                 phishing detection approaches, namely Lists Based, Visual Similarity, Heuristic, Machine Learning, and
                 Deep Learning based techniques, are studied and compared. For this purpose, several algorithms, data
                 sets, and techniques for phishing website detection are revealed with the proposed research questions.
                 A systematic Literature survey was conducted on 80 scientific papers published in the last five years
                 in research journals, conferences, leading workshops, the thesis of researchers, book chapters, and
                 from high-rank websites. The work carried out in this study is an update in the previous systematic
                 literature surveys with more focus on the latest trends in phishing detection techniques. This study
                 enhances readers' understanding of different types of phishing website detection techniques, the data
                 sets used, and the comparative performance of algorithms used. Machine Learning techniques have been
                 applied the most, i.e., 57 as per studies, according to the SLR. In addition, the survey revealed that
                 while gathering the data sets, researchers primarily accessed two sources: 53 studies accessed the
                 PhishTank website (53 for the phishing data set) and 29 studies used Alexa's website for downloading
                 legitimate data sets. Also, as per the literature survey, most studies used Machine Learning
                 techniques; 31 used Random Forest Classifier. Finally, as per different studies, Convolution Neural
                 Network (CNN) achieved the highest Accuracy, 99.98%, for detecting phishing websites.",

                 ephemeral nature of much web content makes web knowledge preservation vital in preserving human
                 knowledge and memories. Web archives are created to preserve the current web and make it available for
                 future reuse. In addition to its preservation purpose, web archive data is also used as a source for
                 research and for lost information discovery. However, the reuse of web archive data is inherently
                 challenging because of the scale of data size and requirements of big data tools to serve and analyze
                 web archive data efficiently. In this research, we propose to build a web archive big data processing
                 infrastructure that can support efficient and scalable web archive reuse like quantitative data
                 analysis and browsing services. We adopt industry frameworks and tools to establish a platform that can
                 provide high-performance computation for web archive initiatives and users. We propose to convert the
                 standard web archive data file format to a columnar data format for efficient future reuse. Our
                 experiments show that our proposed design can significantly improve quantitative data analysis tasks
                 for common web archive data usage. Our design can also serve an efficient web browsing service without

                 also integrate Twitter data into our design as a unique web archive resource. Twitter is a prominent
                 source of data for researchers in a variety of fields and an integral element of the web's history. We
                 aggregate the Twitter data from different sources and integrate it into the suggested design for reuse.

  abstract     = "Do we live in a {"}Golden Age of Conspiracy Theories?{"} In the last few decades, conspiracy theories
                 have proliferated on the Internet with some having dangerous real-world consequences. A large
                 contingent of those who participated in the January 6th attack on the US Capitol believed fervently in
                 the QAnon conspiracy theory. In this work, we study the relationships amongst five prominent conspiracy
                 theories (QAnon, COVID, UFO/Aliens, 9-11, and Flat-Earth) and each of their respective relationships to
                 the news media, both mainstream and fringe. Identifying and publishing a set of 755 different
                 conspiracy theory websites dedicated to our five conspiracy theories, we find that each set often
                 hyperlinks to the same external domains, with COVID and QAnon conspiracy theory websites largest amount
                 of shared connections. Examining the role of news media, we further find that not only do outlets known
                 for spreading misinformation hyperlink to our set of conspiracy theory websites more often than
                 mainstream websites but this hyperlinking has increased dramatically between 2018 and 2021, with the
                 advent of QAnon and the start of COVID-19 pandemic. Using partial Granger-causality, we uncover several
                 positive correlative relationships between the hyperlinks from misinformation websites and the
                 popularity of conspiracy theory websites, suggesting the prominent role that misinformation news
                 outlets play in popularizing many conspiracy theories.",
  cc-snippet   = "Using our own web scrapes and pages historically scraped by Common Crawl,¹
                 [¹https://commoncrawl.org/] we then document the state and the changing behaviors of the conspiracy
                 theory ecosystem and their relationship to a separate set of 530 known misinformation outlets, 565
                 authentic news websites, and 528 non-news websites. [...] Utilizing the Common Crawl harmonic and
                 PageRank centrality measures that measure a website’s centrality across all of the crawled Internet,
                 we then find many of the websites in our dataset have relatively high network centrality, suggesting
                 that many of them are not peripheral on the Internet but actually near the Internet’s core/are
                 mainstream. Indeed examining, the hyperlink connections between news media and these conspiracy
                 theories, we find that many of them rely heavily on mainstream as well as misinformation outlets
                 (compared to non-news websites) for their information, with many popular misinformation outlets also
                 hyperlinking back to many of these conspiracy theory websites. [...] 4.1 Common Crawl Page Retrieval
                 and Website Crawling To gather the set of hyperlinks between our websites, we utilize Common Crawl data
                 [92]—widely considered the most complete publicly available source of web crawl data—and our own
                 website crawls. For each website in our dataset, we collect all the domain’s HTML pages that were
                 indexed by Common Crawl before August 2021. In addition to Common Crawl data, we further utilize our
                 own website scrapes. We utilize our own crawls, in addition to Common Crawl, due to noisiness, missing
                 pages, and missing domains within the Common Crawl dataset [85]. For example, 309 particularly small
                 conspiracy theory domains were not contained within the Common Crawl dataset (i.e. these websites often
                 only contained a few dozen pages). Thus for each website in our dataset, we further gather all the HTML
                 pages 10 hops from each website’s homepage (i.e., we collect all URLs linked from the homepage (1st
                 hop), then all URLs linked from the pages that were linked by the homepage (2nd hop), and so forth).
                 For each HTML page from our scrapes and Common Crawl, we parse the HTML, detect the date that page was
                 published, and collect hyperlinks to other pages (i.e., HTML <a> tags). Altogether we gather the
                 available Common Crawl pages and scrape the HTML for our 755 conspiracy theory, 530 misinformation, 565
                 authentic news, and 528 non-news websites. [...] Utilizing Common Crawl network data [ 61] over the
                 indexed Internet (87.7 million websites), we thus determine the network centrality of our set of
                 conspiracy-focused websites to understand if each conspiracy theory website category is “core”
                 (regularly utilized on the Internet) or “peripheral”. We utilize centralities across Common
                 Crawl’s dataset rather than our partial one in order to get a sense of each conspiracy theory’s
                 centrality on the entire Internet. While only 446 of our conspiracy theory websites are within the
                 Common Crawl dataset, this analysis allows us to fully understand the relative roles that each
                 conspiracy theory website group in our dataset plays on the wider Internet.",

                 this paper, we introduce two new dataset poisoning attacks that intentionally introduce malicious
                 examples to a model's performance. Our attacks are immediately practical and could, today, poison 10
                 popular datasets. Our first attack, split-view poisoning, exploits the mutable nature of internet
                 content to ensure a dataset annotator's initial view of the dataset differs from the view downloaded by
                 subsequent clients. By exploiting specific invalid trust assumptions, we show how we could have
                 poisoned 0.01% of the LAION-400M or COYO-700M datasets for just $60 USD. Our second attack,
                 frontrunning poisoning, targets web-scale datasets that periodically snapshot crowd-sourced content --
                 such as Wikipedia -- where an attacker only needs a time-limited window to inject malicious examples.
                 In light of both attacks, we notify the maintainers of each affected dataset and recommended several
                 low-overhead defenses.",
  cc-snippet   = "B.3 Common Crawl Common Crawl is a petabyte-scale corpus of web crawl data that is repeatedly captured
                 on a roughly monthly basis. Each archive is a complete re-crawl of the internet that records the full
                 activity, including all requests of the crawler and the host responses—with both HTTP headers and
                 content. As such, each archive contains a static snapshot of all crawled pages at the time of visit.
                 This may include new page content not seen during a previous crawl, and may exclude content that has
                 become stale since the previous crawl. For example, data crawled during September 24 through October 8,
                 2022 contains 3.15 billion web pages with 380 TiB of uncompressed content from 34 million registered
                 domains—1.3 billion URLs were not visited in any of the prior crawls.¹⁴ The Common Crawl dataset
                 is vulnerable to an attack which is similar to both our frontrunning and split-view poisoning attacks.
                 The adversary can purchase an expired domain which was previously contained in the Common Crawl, and it
                 will be re-crawled with the adversary’s choice of content, which will then appear in subsequent
                 Common Crawl snap- shots. Notice that, differently from the snapshot-poisoning attack on Wikipedia,
                 there is no content moderation here and so the adversary simply needs to continue to control the domain
                 to poison all future Common Crawl snapshots. Buying recently-expired domains that existed in previous
                 Common Crawl snapshots allows a stronger form of attack where the attack can inject entirely new links
                 into the crawl. This can be accomplished by adding links or subdomains to poisoned domains, and
                 allowing the crawler to discover the new poisoned domains. Thus, an adversary may inject arbitrarily
                 many pages into the Common Crawl dataset, not only from the originally expired subset. We do not
                 implement this attack following our ethics statements outlined earlier. Since Common Crawl WARC files
                 have been hosted by Amazon on a AWS Athena (serverless service)¹⁵, domain reconnaissance work to
                 analyze URLs is inexpensive. Scanning through 10 years of Common Crawl data to analyze domains from
                 popular TLDs and high number of Common Crawl entries cost us USD$ 0.84. While additional analysis might
                 somewhat increase this cost, it remains an inexpensive way to search for vulnerable domains. Buying
                 recently expired domains, or domains that have a dangling DNS record with an active IP address is
                 preferred, as domains that failed to return a 200-OK status in consecutive crawls seem to be moved to a
                 lower priority. For example, among expired domains we purchased, just one domain accounts for more than
                 90% of all status codes among the purchased domains, while other domains we purchased as early as
                 12/20/2020 have seen relatively less scraping traffic across a 3 year period.16 Because Common Crawl is
                 enormous and uncurated (to accurately reflect the content of the internet) poisoning all of Common
                 Crawl is impractical due to size. Additionally, it is not always apparent how consumers of this data
                 are process- ing it for downstream machine learning tasks. However, there exist many derivative
                 datasets which are constructed by curating a relevant subset of the Common Crawl. This includes the
                 LAION-5B image dataset [57], the text dataset known as the Pile [23], the multilingual text dataset
                 CC-100 [78], and the CCMatrix dataset [61], a translation dataset of pairs of translated sentences.
                 Such curation actually amplifies the power of an attack: an attack which adds 1MB of text to the Common
                 Crawl would be poisoning a 2.5 · 10−9 fraction of the Common Crawl, but if this text bypasses the
                 curation done for the CC-100 dataset, it could instead poison a 1.2 · 10−5 fraction of the English
                 corpus, or even a full 9.1% of the Oromo corpus.",

                 including degradation of the digital commons and unemployment from automation. The rapid pace of AI
                 development and deployment currently leaves little room for this power. Monopolized in the hands of
                 private corporations, the development of the most capable foundation models has proceeded largely

                 progress has been possible thanks to the use of language models pretrained on large amounts of

                 monolingual, or nonpublic. Our goal in this paper is to propose an efficient pipeline for creating a
                 big-scale, diverse, multilingual corpus of PDF files from all over the Internet using Common Crawl, as
                 PDF files are the most canonical types of documents as considered in document understanding. We

  cc-snippet   = "As our input we used web indexes created by Common Crawl. [...] They crawl webpages and save them into
                 crawls dumps. A crawl dump contains billions of webpages (hundreds of terabytes of uncompressed data)
                 and a new dump has been published nearly every month since March 2014. Some earlier, more irregular
                 dumps starting from 2008 are also available.¹¹ Each dump also contains an index of the crawled pages.
                 We decided to simply use the latest (and the largest) dump available at the time of writing this paper
                 — the May 2022 dump.¹² [¹²https://commoncrawl.org/2022/06/may-2022-crawl-archive-now-available/]
                 It contains 3.45 billion web pages, which amounts to 462 TB of uncompressed content. It would obviously
                 be possible to apply the extraction procedure described in this paper to all crawls to obtain an even
                 larger collection of PDFs, which would also allow for a diachronic analysis, but we wanted to focus on
                 the most recent documents. Note that dumps contain only files considered as text files by the Common
                 Crawl web robot. Mostly these are web pages in the HTML format, but, fortunately, PDFs are also treated
                 as text files, being derivative of the PostScript page description language. This is not the case with,
                 for instance, images, Excel files, DOCX files. Consequently, such files cannot be amassed using the
                 methods described in the aforementioned papers.¶ 3.2 PDF links extraction¶ We experimented with two
                 methods for extracting links to PDF files (step 1 in Figure 1):¶ 1. using CDX files, i.e., index
                 server files provided by Common Crawl;¶ 2. looking for links to PDF files in WARC, i.e., raw crawl
                 data files.¶ The first method is simpler, as CDX files are easy to download and take up only 225 GB in
                 total. The second method might yield more links to PDF files, but:¶ – it is impossible for us to
                 download all WARCs. Only a limited number of them can be processed, though still a significant number
                 of PDF links can be added even if a small percentage of all WARC files are processed,¶ – there is
                 lower probability that the file linked is available at all, be it in the crawl dump or simply at the
                 original address.¶ In CDX files, the MIME type of a captured file is specified, and we limited
                 ourselves to the application/pdf type.¶ Hence, in this paper, we focus on the first method, which
                 allows to speed up the whole processing pipeline.",

                 Borders due to its extensively censored Internet and strictly regulated information control policies.
                 Existing reports of filtering in Turkmenistan rely on a handful of vantage points or test a small
                 number of websites. Yet, the country’s poor Internet adoption rates and small population can make
                 more comprehensive measurement challenging. With a population of only six million people and an
                 Internet penetration rate of only 38%, it is challenging to either recruit in-country volunteers or
                 obtain vantage points to conduct remote network measurements at scale. We present the largest
                 measurement study to date of Turkmenistan’s Web censorship. To do so, we developed TMC, which tests
                 the blocking status of millions of domains across the three foundational protocols of the Web (DNS,
                 HTTP, and HTTPS). Importantly, TMC does not require access to vantage points in the country. We apply
                 TMC to 15.5M domains, our results reveal that Turkmenistan censors more than 122K domains, using
                 different blocklists for each protocol. We also reverse-engineer these censored domains, identifying 6K
                 over-blocking rules causing incidental filtering of more than 5.4M domains. Finally, we use , an
                 open-source censorship evasion tool, to discover five new censorship evasion strategies that can defeat
                 Turkmenistan’s censorship at both transport and application layers. We will publicly release both the

                 the Common Crawl version 2019-18, which is the default version for c4. Next, we extract the URLs for
                 downloadable images from the raw WAT files. We restrict the image extension to either png/jpeg/jpg, and
                 exclude image URLs that contain the following tokens: tlogo, button, icon, plugin, widgetu. We attempt
                 to download from these URLs, and resize images to a maximum dimension of 800px. We eliminate any c4
                 documents that do not contain valid, downloadable images at the time of collection (mid-to-late 2022).

                 the database file. This allows for the requested backlink data to be easily located. With a simple

                 legal and ethical risks when data creators fail to receive appropriate attribution or compensation. In
                 the United States and several other countries, copyrighted content may be used to build foundation
                 models without incurring liability due to the fair use doctrine. However, there is a caveat: If the
                 model produces output that is similar to copyrighted data, particularly in scenarios that affect the
                 market of that data, fair use may no longer apply to the output of the model. In this work, we
                 emphasize that fair use is not guaranteed, and additional work may be necessary to keep model
                 development and deployment squarely in the realm of fair use. First, we survey the potential risks of
                 developing and deploying foundation models based on copyrighted content. We review relevant U.S. case
                 law, drawing parallels to existing and potential applications for generating text, source code, and
                 visual art. Experiments confirm that popular foundation models can generate content considerably
                 similar to copyrighted material. Second, we discuss technical mitigations that can help foundation
                 models stay in line with fair use. We argue that more research is needed to align mitigation strategies
                 with the current state of the law. Lastly, we suggest that the law and technical mitigations should
                 co-evolve. For example, coupled with other policy mechanisms, the law could more explicitly consider
                 safe harbors when strong technical tools are used to mitigate infringement harms. This co-evolution may
                 help strike a balance between intellectual property and innovation, which speaks to the original goal
                 of fair use. But we emphasize that the strategies we describe here are not a panacea and more work is
                 needed to develop policies that address the potential harms of foundation models.",
  cc-snippet   = "Implied Licenses and Common Crawl. On the other hand, many creators voluntarily post their works on
                 the internet with permissions for web crawling. It is well-established that merely posting something on
                 the internet does not waive the intellectual property interest in the work, but many data creators use
                 an industry-standard “robots.txt{"} file to affirmatively to include their website and data in caches
                 and search indexes. In Field v. Google, Inc. (D. Nev. 2006) a district court held that Google could
                 cache web content that did not disallow scraping via robots.txt, suggesting that there was an implied
                 license and thus the use was not infringement. This license only extended to caching in that case,
                 which does not necessarily reflect the uses of foundation models we discuss throughout this work, so it
                 is unlikely to cover all the use cases we describe here. And the bounds of the uses covered by the
                 robots.txt file are untested in court.21 While the issue of whether the implied license extends to
                 foundation model training has not been resolved in litigation, it is possible that an outcome like
                 Field v. Google, Inc. (D. Nev. 2006) would extend to some foundation model uses—in particular, for
                 building a cached dataset and training a model.¶ It is worth noting that the use of a robots.txt
                 header or other opt-out mechanism has implications for fair use also. Datasets and models like C4
                 (Raffel et al., 2019) and LAION-400M (Schuhmann, 2021), rely on CommonCrawl data which is crawled only
                 if users explicitly allow it through their robots.txt file. CommonCrawl is able to host a snapshot of
                 the internet largely because of fair use arguments. As the organization’s director argues, there is a
                 transformation into a different—not easily human-readable—format, the organization does not take a
                 snapshot of entire webpages, and the use itself is transformative (from actively presenting content to
                 caching content) and for the public benefit (Leetaru, 2017). In Field v. Google, Inc. (D. Nev. 2006),
                 respect for the robots.txt file also was considered in the fair use assessment with the court noting
                 that Google in good faith followed industry standards that would prevent caching (respecting
                 disallowing crawling via a robots.txt). It is possible, then, that providing an opt-out mechanism for
                 data creators and respecting the robots.txt opt-out mechanism will be taken into account in assessing a
                 fair use argument, as it was in Field v. Google, Inc. (D. Nev. 2006).²²¶ [...] Furthermore, if
                 web-crawled data is used, restricting it to data that respects robots.txt opt-outs can make a fair use
                 argument more tractable, though not guaranteed. As we noted before, in Field v. Google, Inc. (D. Nev.
                 2006), respect for the robots.txt file was considered in the fair use assessment with the court because
                 it gave the plaintiff opportunity to opt out. This is likely why many webcrawl-based models rely on the
                 CommonCrawl dataset as a source. Its webcrawl automatically respects robots.txt opt-outs and does not
                 crawl every webpage in full. It is possible then that future fair use assessments could consider
                 respecting the robots.txt opt-out—or implementing other opt-out mechanisms—favorably, as was the
                 case in Field v. Google, Inc. (D. Nev. 2006). Conversely, ignoring a robots.txt opt-out could
                 negatively impact a fair use assessment. However, Kapoor & Narayanan (2023) have argued that there are
                 structural critiques of opt-out mechanisms beyond the current state of the law.¶",

  abstract = {Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.},
  cc-snippet = {CommonCrawl. CommonCrawl [132] is one of the largest
open-source web crawling databases, containing a petabyte-
scale data volume, which has been widely used as training
data for existing LLMs. As the whole dataset is very large,
existing studies mainly extract subsets of web pages from
it within a specific period. However, due to the widespread
existence of noisy and low-quality information in web data,
it is necessary to perform data preprocessing before usage.
Based on CommonCrawl, there are four filtered datasets
that are commonly used in existing work: C4 [73], CC-
Stories [124], CC-News [27], and RealNews [125]. The Colos-
sal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4) includes five variants¹⁸, [¹⁸https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4] namely en (806G), en.noclean (6T), realnewslike (36G), web-
textlike (17G), and multilingual (38T). The en version has
been utilized for pre-training T5 [73], LaMDA [63], Go-
pher [59], and UL2 [80]. The multilingual C4, also called
mC4, has been used in mT5 [74]. CC-Stories (31G) is com-
posed of a subset of CommonCrawl data, in which the
contents are made in a story-like way. While, the original
source of CC-Stories is not available now, so a reproduction
version, CC-Stories-R [133], has been included in Table 2.
Moreover, two news corpora extracted from Common-
Crawl, i.e., REALNEWS (120G) and CC-News (76G), are also
commonly used as the pre-training data.},

                 transform the current hostile zero-sum game relationship between AI tools and a majority of copyrighted
                 data owners into a collaborative and mutually beneficial one, which is necessary to facilitate the
                 development of a virtuous cycle among AI tools, their users and data providers that drives forward AI
                 technology and builds a healthy AI ecosystem. However, current revenue-sharing business models do not
                 work for AI tools in the forthcoming AI era, since the most widely used metrics for website-based
                 traffic and action, such as clicks, will be replaced by new metrics such as prompts and cost per prompt
                 for generative AI tools. A completely new revenue-sharing business model, which must be almost
                 independent of AI tools and be easily explained to data providers, needs to establish a prompt-based
                 scoring system to measure data engagement of each data provider. This paper systematically discusses
                 how to build such a scoring system for all data providers for AI tools based on classification and
                 content similarity models, and outlines the requirements for AI tools or third parties to build it.
                 Sharing revenue with data providers using such a scoring system would encourage more data owners to
                 participate in the revenue-sharing program. This will be a utilitarian AI era where all parties

                 adaptability compared to their parametric counterparts, by incorporating retrieved text from external
                 datastores. While it is well known that parametric models are prone to leaking private data, it remains
                 unclear how the addition of a retrieval datastore impacts model privacy. In this work, we present the
                 first study of privacy risks in retrieval-based LMs, particularly kNN-LMs. Our goal is to explore the
                 optimal design and training procedure in domains where privacy is of concern, aiming to strike a
                 balance between utility and privacy. Crucially, we find that kNN-LMs are more susceptible to leaking
                 private information from their private datastore than parametric models. We further explore mitigations
                 of privacy risks. When privacy information is targeted and readily detected in the text, we find that a
                 simple sanitization step would completely eliminate the risks, while decoupling query and key encoders
                 achieves an even better utility-privacy trade-off. Otherwise, we consider strategies of mixing public
                 and private data in both datastore and encoder training. While these methods offer modest improvements,
                 they leave considerable room for future work. Together, our findings provide insights for practitioners

                 Despite this, pretraining data design is critically under-documented and often guided by empirically
                 unsupported intuitions. To address this, we pretrain 28 1.5B parameter decoder-only models, training on
                 data curated (1) at different times, (2) with varying toxicity and quality filters, and (3) with
                 different domain compositions. First, we quantify the effect of pretraining data age. A temporal shift
                 between evaluation data and pretraining data leads to performance degradation, which is not overcome by
                 finetuning. Second, we explore the effect of quality and toxicity filters, showing a trade-off between

                 high in MMS-lab compared to Common Crawl, then we add it to the subset of words we include in our
                 study. This enables us to evaluate on 51 languages of the FLEURS corpus since not all languages are
                 covered by MMS-lab and we also need to find data in Common Crawl for each language. The automatic

                 collection for the NTCIR-16 We Want Web (WWW-4) task, which concluded in June 2022. More specifically,
                 through the test collection construction effort, we examined two factors that may affect the relevance
                 assessments of depth-k pools, which in turn may affect the relative evaluation of different IR systems.
                 The first factor is the document ordering strategy for the assessors, namely, prioritisation (PRI) and
                 randomisation (RND). PRI is a method that has been used in NTCIR tasks for over a decade; it ranks the
                 pooled documents by a kind of pseudorelevance for the assessors. The second factor is assessor type,
                 i.e., Gold or Bronze. Gold assessors are the topic creators and therefore they “know” which
                 documents are (highly) relevant and which are not; Bronze assessors are not the topic creators and may
                 lack sufficient knowledge about the topics. We believe that our study is unique in that the authors of
                 this paper served as the Gold assessors when creating the WWW-4 test collection, which enabled us to
                 closely examine why Bronze assessments differ from the Gold ones. Our research questions examine
                 assessor efficiency (RQ1), inter-assessor agreement (RQ2), system ranking similarity with different
                 qrels files (RQ3), system ranking robustness to the choice of test topics (RQ4), and the reasons why
                 Bronze assessors tend to be more liberal than Gold assessors (RQ5). The most remarkable of our results
                 are as follows. Firstly, in the comparisons for RQ1 through RQ4, it turned out that what may matter
                 more than the document ordering strategy (PRI vs. RND) and the assessor type (Gold vs. Bronze) is how
                 well-motivated and/or well-trained the Bronze assessors are. Secondly, regarding RQ5, of the documents
                 originally judged nonrelevant by the Gold assessors contrary to the Bronze assessors in our
                 experiments, almost one half were truly relevant according to the Gold assessors’ own
                 reconsiderations. This result suggests that even Gold assessors are far from perfect; budget
                 permitting, it may be beneficial to hire highly-motivated Bronze assessors in addition to Gold
                 assessors so that they can complement each other.",
